# Here you'll find the assignments we've completed in prac comp 2022. The files should be named as we named them in class.

## There are 3 folders
1) data - where you will find the raw data used as input 
2) results - some of the figures we've created in class 
3) src - Rmd files from our R tutorials as well as the dna calc assignment 

## There is also two files that contain my entire terminal/R log from the entire semester, just in case
